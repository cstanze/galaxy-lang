# Galaxy Lang

**Warning!**
This is some very bad code (long before I understood the work required to work on even a simple language like this). Feel free to take a look around but don't get mad at me when you can't read the horribly written code - I warned you!

A simple lang, based on yaml, that lets a developer create a tiny little galaxy to a large galaxy with hundreds of planets.
